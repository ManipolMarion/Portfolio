# Portfolio

This repository contains samples and proof of work for the projects listed on my resume.

- **SouthAlps**  
   This folder contains code for a website where I contributed back-end functionality using NodeJS. The site allows for content management with minimal coding knowledge. My contributions include implementing email-based contact forms, admin login/logout functionality, and dynamic text field editing, among other features. [Linked here is a video demonstrating the features](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XpV7D881eI3MdROXofu07C9ptmyR-UWm/view?usp=sharing).

- **Database Design**  
   This folder contains a screenshot of a star schema I co-designed, aimed at consolidating retailer information and product sales from multiple sources. Also included is a PDF with sample data extracted from the newly created database.

- **UI/UX Prototype**  
   This is a [Figma UI/UX prototype](https://www.figma.com/design/KqstGfu15nMHSp3RCqOGB6/Go-Wireframe?node-id=0-1&t=Dz7WGhf5Fb8ePvFV-1) for a proposed app that helps users navigate unfamiliar commuting routes. I created the assets used in this prototype and implemented its interactivity.
